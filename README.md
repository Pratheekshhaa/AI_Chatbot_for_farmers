# Farmer Friend – Multimodal AI-Based Agricultural Advisory System

Farmer Friend is a locally deployable, multimodal agricultural advisory system designed to assist farmers with crop-related decision making using text, voice, and image inputs. The system combines a large language model with computer vision, speech recognition, weather intelligence, and structured agricultural datasets to provide reliable, context-aware recommendations.

The primary goal of this project is to reduce farmers’ dependence on scarce agricultural experts by delivering accessible, multilingual, and real-time advisory support that can run on consumer-grade hardware without cloud dependency.
